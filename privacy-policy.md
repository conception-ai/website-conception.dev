# Point&Click Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: October 23, 2025*

## Introduction

Conception AI Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use Point&Click, our web automation browser extension and platform (the "Services").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services.

Conception AI Inc. is the entity responsible for the processing of personal information under this Privacy Policy as a data controller.

## Definitions

**Automation Flow or Flow:** means an automated workflow to perform tasks on websites.

**Building Block:** means a deterministic or semi-determinist, pre-written automation script for specific actions.

**Actions:** means operations, steps, or transactions executed by Automation Flows, including screen recordings and content of websites visited.

**Input:** means data you provide to Flows, including natural language prompts, website credentials, and instructions.

**Output:** means results produced by Flows, including downloaded files, extracted data, and execution reports.

**You:** means any person who uses or accesses the Services, or whose personal information may be processed through use of our Services.

## Information We Collect

We collect personal information that you provide directly when you register, use the Services, or communicate with us, including contact information, account credentials, payment information, profile information, and communication preferences.

When you use our Services, we collect information about Flows you create and execute, data processed through our automation platform, website credentials you choose to store which are encrypted, performance metrics, natural language prompts, and websites you automate.

During Flow execution, we record your screen and capture visual content displayed in your browser. These screen recordings may capture sensitive information that happens to be visible in your browser, including personal messages, financial information, private documents, or confidential business information.

## Beta Period Data Collection

During the beta testing period, we have significantly broader access to your data. We may access and review all Flow executions in unencrypted, plain-text form, natural language prompts in full detail, all websites you automate, stored credentials in decrypted form during execution monitoring, complete screen recordings, and any other information generated during your use of the Services.

This comprehensive monitoring is necessary for debugging, platform development, quality assurance, Building Block creation, security monitoring, and service improvement during the beta period.

Upon transition to general availability, we will implement stricter data access controls and limitations.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve the Services, execute your Automation Flows, process transactions and manage your account, and provide customer support.

During the beta period specifically, we use your data to debug issues, improve Flow reliability, create and optimize Building Blocks, train and improve our AI models and agents, and conduct quality assurance.

After the beta period, we will only use aggregated and anonymized data for service improvement, and will not use the specific content of your Flows without your explicit consent.

## Artificial Intelligence Provided by Third Parties

Point&Click leverages third-party AI technology to power our agent-based automation capabilities. We share your information with AI service providers, including natural language prompts, information about websites you want to automate, data about Flow execution and results, screen recordings and browser activity, and Inputs, Actions, and Outputs from your Flows.

During the beta period, AI providers may use your data to improve their models and services. After the beta period ends, AI providers will not use your data to train their models without your explicit consent.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, secure storage of website credentials, access controls, regular security audits, and incident response procedures.

However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of our databases or that information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.

## Your Rights and Choices

You may have the right to request access to your personal information, request correction of inaccurate information, request deletion of your personal information, request restriction of processing, request portability to another service, object to processing for certain purposes, withdraw consent, and opt-out of certain communications.

To exercise these rights, contact us at [contact@conception.dev](mailto:contact@conception.dev).

You have the right to delete your data from our systems at any time through account settings or by contacting us. Upon deletion request, we will permanently delete your data from active databases within 30 days.

## Children's Privacy

Our Services are not intended for individuals under the age of 18. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will delete that information promptly. Contact us at [contact@conception.dev](mailto:contact@conception.dev) if you believe we might have information from a child.

## International Data Transfers

We are based in the United States. Information we collect may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the United States and other jurisdictions. When we engage in cross-border data transfers, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. For material changes, we will provide notice at least 30 days before changes take effect via email or a notice within the Services.

Your continued use of the Services after modifications constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.
