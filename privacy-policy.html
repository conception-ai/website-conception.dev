            <p><strong>Input:</strong> means data you provide to Flows, including natural language prompts, website credentials, and instructions.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect personal information that you provide directly when you register, use the Services, or communicate with us, including contact information, account credentials, payment information, profile information, and communication preferences.</p>
            <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about Flows you create and execute, data processed through our automation platform, website credentials you choose to store which are encrypted, performance metrics, natural language prompts, and websites you automate.</p>
            <p>During Flow execution, we record your screen and capture visual content displayed in your browser. These screen recordings may capture sensitive information that happens to be visible in your browser, including personal messages, financial information, private documents, or confidential business information.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Beta Period Data Collection</h2>
            <p>During the beta testing period, we have significantly broader access to your data. We may access and review all Flow executions in unencrypted, plain-text form, natural language prompts in full detail, all websites you automate, stored credentials in decrypted form during execution monitoring, complete screen recordings, and any other information generated during your use of the Services.</p>
            <p>This comprehensive monitoring is necessary for debugging, platform development, quality assurance, Building Block creation, security monitoring, and service improvement during the beta period.</p>
            <p>Upon transition to general availability, we will implement stricter data access controls and limitations.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve the Services, execute your Automation Flows, process transactions and manage your account, and provide customer support.</p>
            <p>During the beta period specifically, we use your data to debug issues, improve Flow reliability, create and optimize Building Blocks, train and improve our AI models and agents, and conduct quality assurance.</p>
            <p>After the beta period, we will only use aggregated and anonymized data for service improvement, and will not use the specific content of your Flows without your explicit consent.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence Provided by Third Parties</h2>

We share your information with AI service providers, including natural language prompts, information about websites you want to automate, data about Flow execution and results, screen recordings and browser activity, and Inputs, Actions, and Outputs from your Flows.</p>
            <p>During the beta period, AI providers may use your data to improve their models and services. After the beta period ends, AI providers will not use your data to train their models without your explicit consent.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, secure storage of website credentials, access controls, regular security audits, and incident response procedures.</p>
            <p>However, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of our databases or that information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet.</p>
