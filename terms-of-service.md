# Point&Click Terms of Service

*Version Effective Date: October 23, 2025*

## Preamble

These Terms of Service govern Your use of Point&Click services provided by Conception AI Inc., a Delaware corporation at 2261 Market Street STE 85701, San Francisco, CA 94114, United States, operating at [pointandclick.ai](https://pointandclick.ai).

By accessing or using Point&Click, You accept these Terms of Service. You must read these Terms carefully before using Point&Click.

## Key Definitions

**Account:** Your personalized user account required to access Point&Click.

**Actions:** All content, decisions, browsing, and transactions executed by Automation Flows in Your browser and in Your name. All Actions are legally attributed to You.

**Building Block:** A deterministic, pre-written automation script for specific actions with high reliability.

**Automation Flow or Flow:** An automated workflow to perform tasks on websites.

**Input:** Data you provide to Flows, including prompts, credentials, and instructions.

**Output:** Results produced by Flows, including downloaded files and extracted data.

## Our Services

Point&Click is a browser extension that automates web actions where no API exists. The platform combines deterministic Building Blocks with real-time agent execution for reliable automation.

All execution happens directly in Your browser. We never store Your website credentials on our servers.

### Early Stage Warnings

<div class="warning">Point&Click is in early development with a LIMITED number of established Building Blocks. Most tasks will be executed by our agent in real-time for the first time, with uncertain success rates.</div>

You must actively supervise agent execution, especially for sensitive data or high-value accounts. Do not run automations unattended during beta.

### Browser Control

<div class="warning">By installing Point&Click, You grant Us the ability to execute automations in Your browser at any time while the extension is active, including for testing and diagnostics during beta.</div>

During Flow execution, Point&Click records your screen, capturing all visual content including sensitive information visible in your browser.

### Beta Period

Services are provided free during beta. During beta, we have broad access to all Flow executions, Inputs, Actions, and Outputs in unencrypted form for debugging and platform development.

Beta services are provided "AS IS" without guarantees of uptime, data retention, or feature stability.

## Your Use of the Services

Subject to compliance with these Terms, we grant You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Services for personal or internal business purposes only.

### Prohibited Uses

You shall not use the Services to violate laws or third-party rights, engage in unauthorized access or hacking, collect sensitive personal information without proper authorization, send spam or distribute malware, or violate third-party website terms of service.

### Financial Services Warning

<div class="warning">We strongly discourage using Point&Click with financial services, banking, investment accounts, or payment systems where failures could result in significant financial harm.</div>

Flow execution may fail due to website changes or technical problems. We are not responsible for financial losses, damages, or consequences from failed Flow executions.

## Account and Termination

You must be at least 18 years old to create an Account. You are responsible for maintaining account security and all activities under Your Account.

You may terminate at any time by deleting Your Account. We may terminate immediately for violations, security risks, or legal requirements.

## Intellectual Property

Point&Click retains all rights in the Services. You retain ownership of Your Inputs. We may use aggregated, anonymized data to improve Services.

During beta, we may access and use specific content of Your Flows to debug, create Building Blocks, and train AI models. After beta, we will not use specific content without consent.

## Privacy and Data Protection

Our Privacy Policy at [conception.dev/privacy-policy](https://conception.dev/privacy-policy) describes how we collect, use, and protect Your information.

We implement security measures including encryption, access controls, and regular audits. However, no system is completely secure.

## Liability

### Disclaimer of Warranties

<div class="disclaimer">THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT FLOWS WILL EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY OR BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL WEBSITES.</div>

### Limitation of Liability

<div class="disclaimer">WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED $100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS.</div>

You acknowledge that Flow execution may fail and We are not responsible for consequences of failed, incorrect, or delayed executions.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Point&Click and Conception AI Inc. from any claims arising from Your use of Services, violations of these Terms, violations of laws or third-party rights, Your Flows and their execution, or Your negligence.

## Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by California law. Disputes shall be resolved in state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California.

Before legal proceedings, Parties agree to attempt good faith negotiation for at least 30 days.

## Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms at any time. For material changes, we will provide at least 30 days notice. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
