        <h1>Point&Click Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="version">Version Effective Date: October 23, 2025</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service govern Your use of Point&Click services provided by Conception AI Inc., a Delaware corporation at 2261 Market Street STE 85701, San Francisco, CA 94114, United States, operating at <a href="https://pointandclick.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointandclick.ai</a>.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using Point&Click, You accept these Terms of Service. You must read these Terms carefully before using Point&Click.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Account:</strong> Your personalized user account required to access Point&Click.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> All content, decisions, browsing, and transactions executed by Automation Flows in Your browser and in Your name. All Actions are legally attributed to You.</p>
            <p><strong>Building Block:</strong> A deterministic, pre-written automation script for specific actions with high reliability.</p>
            <p><strong>Automation Flow or Flow:</strong> An automated workflow to perform tasks on websites.</p>
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> Data you provide to Flows, including prompts, credentials, and instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Results produced by Flows, including downloaded files and extracted data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>Point&Click is a browser extension that automates web actions where no API exists. The platform combines deterministic Building Blocks with real-time agent execution for reliable automation.</p>
            <p>All execution happens directly in Your browser. We never store Your website credentials on our servers.</p>

            <h3>Early Stage Warnings</h3>
            <p class="warning">Point&Click is in early development with a LIMITED number of established Building Blocks. Most tasks will be executed by our agent in real-time for the first time, with uncertain success rates.</p>
            <p>You must actively supervise agent execution, especially for sensitive data or high-value accounts. Do not run automations unattended during beta.</p>

            <h3>Browser Control</h3>
            <p class="warning">By installing Point&Click, You grant Us the ability to execute automations in Your browser at any time while the extension is active, including for testing and diagnostics during beta.</p>
            <p>During Flow execution, Point&Click records your screen, capturing all visual content including sensitive information visible in your browser.</p>

            <h3>Beta Period</h3>
            <p>Services are provided free during beta. During beta, we have broad access to all Flow executions, Inputs, Actions, and Outputs in unencrypted form for debugging and platform development.</p>
            <p>Beta services are provided "AS IS" without guarantees of uptime, data retention, or feature stability.</p>

            <p>You shall not use the Services to violate laws or third-party rights, engage in unauthorized access or hacking, collect sensitive personal information without proper authorization, send spam or distribute malware, or violate third-party website terms of service.</p>
